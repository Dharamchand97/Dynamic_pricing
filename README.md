# DYNAMIC PRICING FOR RIDE SHARING COMPANY


## Objectives
Develop a predictive model that accurately estimates optimal fares for rides based on real-time market conditions and historical data.
Investigate the impact of various factors such as demand patterns, supply availability, and customer attributes on ride fares.
Implement a dynamic pricing strategy that adjusts fares in response to changing factors to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.

### Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather comprehensive datasets and preprocess them by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and potentially create new ones to enhance the predictive power of the model, considering factors such as demand patterns and supply availability.
Model Selection: Explore various machine learning algorithms, including regression and ensemble methods, to identify the optimal model for dynamic pricing prediction.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train the selected model on the preprocessed dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error.
Dynamic Pricing Implementation: Implement the trained model to dynamically adjust fares in real-time based on changing market conditions, demand patterns, and supply availability, ensuring optimal pricing for each ride.
